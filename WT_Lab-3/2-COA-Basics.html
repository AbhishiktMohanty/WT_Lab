        <p>Computer Organization and Architecture Tutorial provides in-depth knowledge of internal working, structuring,
            and implementation of a computer system.
            Whereas, Organization defines the way the system is structured so that all those catalogued tools can be
            used properly. <br>In general terms, the architecture of a computer system can be considered as a catalogue
            of tools or attributes that are visible to the user such as instruction sets, number of bits used for data,
            addressing techniques, etc.

            Whereas, Organization of a computer system defines the way system is structured so that all those catalogued
            tools can be used. The significant components of Computer organization are ALU, CPU, memory and memory
            organization.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In computer engineering, computer architecture is a description of the structure of a computer system made
            from component parts.[1] It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the
            implementation.[2] At a more detailed level, the description may include the instruction set architecture
            design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.</p>

        <br>
        <p>A computer organization describes the functions and design of the various units of a digital system. <br>
            A general-purpose computer system is the best-known example of a digital system. Other examples include
            telephone switching exchanges, digital voltmeters, digital counters, electronic calculators and digital
            displays.
            <br> Computer architecture deals with the specification of the instruction set and the hardware units that
            implement the instructions.
            <br> Computer hardware consists of electronic circuits, displays, magnetic and optic storage media and also
            the communication facilities.
            <br> Functional units are a part of a CPU that performs the operations and calculations called for by the
            computer program.
            <br> Functional units of a computer system are parts of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) that performs the
            operations and calculations called for by the computer program. A computer consists of five main components
            namely, Input unit, Central Processing Unit, Memory unit Arithmetic & logical unit, Control unit and an
            Output unit.
